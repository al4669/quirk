## Privacy & Data

QUIRK is designed with privacy as the foundation:

- **No data collection** - Zero telemetry, analytics, or tracking
- **Local storage only** - Your notes are stored in your browser's localStorage
- **Works offline** - No internet connection required after initial load
- **No accounts** - No sign-up, no passwords, no user profiles
- **Standard exports** - Your data exports as regular markdown files
- **Self-hostable** - Run entirely from your own server or filesystem

Even when using quirk.uk, your data never leaves your browser. The server only delivers the application files.

## Architecture

QUIRK is built with vanilla JavaScript and a clean, modular architecture:

- **app.js** - Main wallboard class and node management
- **connection-manager.js** - Visual connection system with smooth bezier curves
- **export-manager.js** - Import/export functionality with ZIP support
- **app.css** - Responsive styling with CSS custom properties and hardware acceleration

No frameworks, no build process, no dependencies beyond standard web APIs.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+ 
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Development

No build process needed! Just edit the files and refresh your browser.

For development, consider running a local server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve
```

## Multiple Boards

Create separate boards for different projects:
- Switch between boards via the dropdown
- Each board maintains its own nodes and connections
- Import/export individual boards or everything at once
- Rename and delete boards as needed

## Export & Import

Your data belongs to you:
- Export current board as ZIP with markdown files
- Export all boards as complete backup
- Import previously exported boards
- Connection relationships preserved in JSON metadata
- Standard markdown format ensures future compatibility
